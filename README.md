# Fraud Detection Modeling using XGBoost

This repository contains an R Markdown file (`.Rmd`) that demonstrates the process of building a model to detect potential fraud using the XGBoost algorithm. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the development of a predictive model specifically tuned for fraud detection. Additionally, the target variable was balanced using the SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) algorithm to handle class imbalance.

## Overview

This project is designed to achieve the following objectives:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the dataset, including handling missing values and feature engineering.
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: Use the SMOTE algorithm to balance the target variable, ensuring better model performance.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize and analyze the data to understand the underlying patterns.
- **Modeling with XGBoost**: Develop and tune the XGBoost model, a powerful and efficient gradient boosting algorithm, to predict fraudulent activities.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the XGBoost model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.

## Project Structure

The R Markdown file is organized as follows:

1. **Introduction**: Overview of the project and the objectives of fraud detection.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Steps to clean and prepare the data, including feature selection and engineering.
3. **Handling Class Imbalance**: Application of the SMOTE algorithm to balance the dataset.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visual and statistical exploration of the dataset.
5. **Modeling with XGBoost**: Building and tuning the XGBoost model, including hyperparameter optimization.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Performance assessment using appropriate evaluation metrics.
7. **Conclusion**: Summary of the model's performance and potential improvements for future work.

## Usage

To replicate the analysis and modeling:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `Data-mining-Project [Edited].Rmd` file in RStudio.
3. Ensure that all required libraries are installed. The necessary libraries are loaded at the beginning of the R Markdown file.
4. Knit the `.Rmd` file to generate the report, which can be output as HTML, PDF, or Word.
